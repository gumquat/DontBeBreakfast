## About the Project

Welcome to DontBeBreakfast, our creation born out of the Hacksprint challenge during the final project of our second trimester. Tasked with the freedom to choose any project type, my teammates and I decided to embark on a game development adventure inspired by the most important meal of the day. Breakfast! We crafted a side-scrolling Mario-like game where players take on the role of a worm desperately fleeing from a hungry bird. Our main goal was to create an MVP and showcase it to our peers on stage.

We tackled this challenge by venturing into uncharted territory with Godot, a game development engine we had little working knowledge of. Through trial and error, we honed our ability to learn a new language and effectively translate our ideas into a playable game. By focusing on creating a minimum viable product, we were able to trim the fat off our concept and implement precisely what was needed, laying a solid foundation for future iterations.

## Our Roles

Tayler: My role in this project was to create the enemy units and develop the logic that tracks and chases the player. With a focus on creating challenging yet engaging gameplay mechanics, I ensured that players would feel the thrill of the chase as they navigated through the game environment.

Caramon: Taking the lead in crafting the map and environment, Caramon set the stage for our epic breakfast-themed adventure. Additionally, they contributed to the project by integrating captivating music that enhances the overall gaming experience.

Evan: Evan spearheaded the development of the playable character, breathing life into our worm protagonist. From animations to controls, Evan ensured that players could fully immerse themselves in the world of DontBeBreakfast, guiding their worm through perilous obstacles with finesse.

## Features Implemented

Dynamic Enemy: The enemy bird unit features intelligent tracking and chasing behavior, adding an element of challenge and excitement to the game.

Immersive Environment: Thanks to Caramon, we had an environment and obstacles for our players to avoid and use to try to get away from the pursuer.

Engaging Gameplay: With responsive controls and smooth animations crafted by Evan, players are empowered to navigate the game environment with ease.

## Challenges

Embarking on a project with Godot, an unfamiliar game development engine, presented our team with the initial challenge of diving into an unknown language and running with it. Despite the learning curve, we embraced the opportunity to expand our skill set and quickly familiarized ourselves with the tools necessary to bring our vision to life.

One of the most significant challenges we encountered was ensuring that our project remained focused and didn't fall victim to scope creep. With the temptation to add more features and complexity, we had to continually remind ourselves of our goal to create a minimum viable product (MVP). By staying true to our vision and resisting the urge to overextend, we were able to maintain clarity and deliver a polished product within our timeline.

Throughout development, we encountered several funny bugs that tested our problem-solving skills. One particularly memorable bug involved the walking sound, which would inexplicably start and stop infinitely. We ended up implementing improved if guards to ensure the audio played appropriately only when the character was moving, enhancing the overall gameplay experience. Additionally, I devised a method to halt the sound when the character was airborne or stationary, further refining the game's audio dynamics.

Another audio bug surfaced when the game's music faded as players moved away from the starting position. Caramon devised a clever solution by attaching the audio to the bird itself. This not only resolved the issue but also added an immersive element to the gameplay, intensifying the chase as the bird drew closer.
